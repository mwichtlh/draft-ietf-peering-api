Once both parties have signed the other-party's challenge, both parties know that each party possesses access to private keys associated with the Autonomous Systems on both sides.",

This would allow to:\r\n- reuse current identity management solutions based on bearer tokens for async validation\r\n- maintain attestation of individual caller identities on API requests as well as the capability to constrain access to parts of the API defined in this doc via usual scopes or other claims\r\n- extend the integrity checks to the entire API call payload, beyond reliance on a TLS transport, for proof of possession and HTTP signing when those become standard (e.g. [RFC9449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449))\r\n\r\nI would also defer this to a separate RFC process that builds atop this doc and now gather consensus on the peering API using a bespoke authz implementation.",
