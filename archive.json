Once both parties have signed the other-party's challenge, both parties know that each party possesses access to private keys associated with the Autonomous Systems on both sides.",

This would allow to:\r\n- reuse current identity management solutions based on bearer tokens for async validation\r\n- maintain attestation of individual caller identities on API requests as well as the capability to constrain access to parts of the API defined in this doc via usual scopes or other claims\r\n- extend the integrity checks to the entire API call payload, beyond reliance on a TLS transport, for proof of possession and HTTP signing when those become standard (e.g. [RFC9449](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449))\r\n\r\nI would also defer this to a separate RFC process that builds atop this doc and now gather consensus on the peering API using a bespoke authz implementation.",

      "body": "After our discussion today, I thought more about whether or not you could impersonate someone with the PeeringDB Token.\r\n\r\nThe token we ask for from the user is the access token, not the authorization code.  Authorization code comes first, and is what you use to get a token.  The token is then put in the headers of the call.\r\n\r\nOf note: when you go to register an oauth app on PeeringDB, you get a client ID, which you pass back in order to get an authorization code.  \r\nLater, you take the authorization code, and pass that back to peeringDB to get a token.\r\n\r\nOnce you have the token, one can \"forget about\" the client ID (PeeringDB does not need the client ID to validate the token, it validates the token on its own).  I don't believe this poses a problem to the API, as our implementation only wants the token.  Clients can set up their own \"token-fetching\" method separately.\r\n\r\nIt turns out the lead author on OAuth comes to the IETF regularly (as it is an IETF working group), so maybe we can get his opinion as well.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it doesn't look like you can take actions on PeeringDB with only the access token (at least from a quick look, I didn't poke too hard), but maybe @grizz would have a better idea (looking at https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/131)\r\ncc @caguado for discussion as well.",
